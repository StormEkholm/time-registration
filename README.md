### Field Breakdown

1st Field: A selection field used for determining which customer the work was done for, the options is pulled from the customer table in the database.

When marking the field a dropdown of options is displayed, this contains a search field where the user can input the customer name.
If the customer does not already exist the name can be completed and a option with that name can be selected.

The form will now display that the new customer will be created on submit.

This field works in the same way as the customer example regarding creation of new projects.

### Validation

If all fields are filled in correctly, a creation of the registration is now possible,
and the employee can click the save button at the bottom.


### Comments
This project was created for a buisness for use internally.
Security is a consern in this project and for that reason all database information has been removed from the code contained in this repository.
This means that the project can not be downloaded and displayed live, this is merely for demonstration of work done.
